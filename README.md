# vaquita
Have a whip-round with friends or family. You know how they say: "Short debts make long friends".

## Name
The term `vaquita` (little cow in Spanish) is used in Argentina to refer to the act of spliting up costs for an event across a grup of participants.

## Origin
I started this project as part of my presentation "Functional Programming with Haskell" during @zipMoney Brain Week,
but I intend to keep working on it. You can find the source file for the slides and live coding examples in [this branch](https://github.com/ktonga/vaquita/tree/zip-brain-week).  

Telegram Bot coming up! To enable splitting of expenses within a group.
